**103 assessment Read me for the vechile insurance system**

**important information**
1. must be run in a separate window, not the terminal in say visual studio code. visual studio community's run window or running directly from the exe is fine

*this is due to the use of 'system("CLS")' in the code to clear the screen, which messes with terminals that cannot be cleared*

2. make sure to include the supportive files e.g. comprehensive_info.txt all are included in the code file in the github.
3. the csv files are examples of when accounts and policies etc are already registered. these can be included in the code directory on your pc or created from scratch by using the system.
4. if you start with no csv files, there is no default admin, so you must create an account and change collum I in customer registration spreedsheet
